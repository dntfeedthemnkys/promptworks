# promptworks

promptworks is a curated collection of prompts I use regularly across product management, strategy, research, writing, and general problem solving.

These prompts are designed to be:
- reusable rather than one-off
- clear about intent and role
- easy to adapt to different contexts
- practical in real workflows, not theoretical

They are shared openly in case others find them useful, or as a reference point for how I think about structuring effective prompts.

## What this repository is
- A working library of prompts that I actually use
- A place to refine and improve prompts over time
- A reference for common patterns such as analysis, drafting, comparison, and ideation

## What this repository is not
- A collection of proprietary or confidential material
- A guarantee that any prompt is optimal for every model or use case
- A static or finished artefact

Prompts evolve. Models change. Treat these as starting points.

## Quick Start
1. Browse prompts by category in the folders below
2. Copy prompts directly or adapt them to your needs
3. Check individual prompt files for usage notes and variations

## Structure
```
prompts/
├── creative-and-ideation/      # Brainstorming, creative thinking, innovation
├── decision-support/           # Decision making, trade-off analysis, prioritization
├── image-generation/           # Visual content creation, image prompts
├── personal-and-lifestyle/     # Personal development, health, life management
├── physical-performance/       # Fitness, training, athletic performance
├── product-management/         # Strategic planning, roadmapping, prioritization
├── research-and-analysis/      # User research, competitive analysis, insights
├── technical-and-tools/        # Technical documentation, tool usage, development
└── writing-and-communication/  # Content creation, editing, communication
```

Prompts are grouped by intent rather than tool or model. Each folder contains individual prompt files with:
- a clear title
- a short description of when to use it
- the prompt text itself
- optional notes or variations

## Example Prompt Format
Each prompt file follows this structure:
```markdown
# Title

## Purpose
Brief description of when and why to use this prompt.

## Prompt
```text

Analytical Frame

Output Format

```

## Notes (Optional)
Additional context, variations, or usage tips.

## How to use these prompts
- Copy and adapt freely
- Replace role assumptions, tone, and constraints as needed
- Combine prompts into workflows if that suits your use case

If you improve or adapt something in a way that feels generally useful, contributions are welcome.
