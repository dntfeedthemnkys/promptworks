# TDEE Estimation Prompt (Beginner-Friendly)

This prompt helps you estimate your **TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)** using an AI tool (such as ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, or Grok).

TDEE is the number of calories your body burns in a day.  
Knowing it gives you a sensible starting point for fat loss, maintenance, or muscle gain.

This process is designed to be **simple, cautious, and practical**.  
It does not promise precision. It gives you a starting estimate that you improve with real data.

## How to use this prompt

1. Copy everything in the **Prompt** section below.
2. Paste it into your AI tool of choice  
   (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Grok, or similar).
3. Answer the questions it asks you as honestly and accurately as you can.
4. Use the result as a **starting estimate**, not a final answer.
5. Refine it over 2–3 weeks by tracking food and body weight.

Do not rush this. The estimate is only as good as the information you provide.

## What this prompt does (and does not do)

**What it does**
- Estimates your daily calorie needs at maintenance
- Accounts for real-world movement, not just exercise
- Explains how to test and adjust the estimate

**What it does not do**
- Create a diet plan
- Guarantee accuracy
- Replace tracking or common sense
- Override medical advice

There is no single “correct” TDEE number. Expect a **range**, not a precise value.

## Before you start

If possible, have the following ready:
- Your body weight
- Your height
- A rough idea of how much you move each day
- An estimate of your daily step count (if you track it)

If you do not know something, say so. Guessing is better than skipping.

> You are helping me estimate my **Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)**.
> 
> TDEE means the number of calories I burn per day.
> 
> Please be conservative and practical.  
> This estimate will be refined later using real tracking data.
>
> ### Step 1: Ask me for basic information  
> Ask me for the following details:
>
> - Sex  
> - Age  
> - Height (centimetres)  
> - Body weight (kilograms)  
> - Average daily step count  
>   - If I do not track steps, ask me to describe how much I move in a normal day  
> - My job or daily routine  
>   - Mostly seated  
>   - Mixed movement  
>   - Physically active  
> - Planned exercise per week  
>   - Type (for example walking, gym, sport)  
>   - Duration  
>   - Rough intensity (easy, moderate, hard)
>
> Ask follow-up questions if anything is unclear.
>
> ### Step 2: Estimate BMR  
> Estimate my **Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)** using the **Mifflin–St Jeor equation**.
>
> Explain what BMR means in plain language.
> Show the calculation and the result.
>
> ### Step 3: Estimate daily activity  
> Estimate how much energy I burn above BMR based mainly on:
>
> - How much I move during the day  
> - My step count or movement description  
> - My job  
> - My exercise
>
> Do not assume I am highly active just because I exercise a few times per week.
>
> If you use an activity multiplier, explain why.
>
> ### Step 4: Give the result  
> Show me:
>
> - My estimated BMR  
> - My estimated TDEE as a **range**, not a single number  
> - A short explanation of how you arrived at the estimate
>
> Use cautious assumptions.  
> It is better to slightly underestimate than overestimate.
>
> ### Step 5: Explain how to check and adjust  
> Explain how I can test this estimate over **14 to 21 days** by:
>
> - Tracking calorie intake consistently  
> - Weighing myself daily under the same conditions  
> - Looking at weight trends, not day-to-day changes
>
> Explain what it means if my weight:
> - Stays roughly the same  
> - Slowly goes down  
> - Slowly goes up
>
> ### Style rules  
> - Use plain, non-technical language  
> - Be cautious and realistic  
> - Avoid hype, promises, or motivational slogans  
> - Do not claim medical authority
>
> The goal is a useful starting estimate that improves with real-world data.

## How to use the result

- If your weight stays stable over 2–3 weeks, your intake is close to TDEE.
- If weight trends down, you are in a calorie deficit.
- If weight trends up, you are in a calorie surplus.

Once you know this, you can decide whether to:
- Maintain
- Create a moderate deficit
- Increase intake for performance or muscle gain

TDEE changes over time. Revisit this process if your body weight, job, or activity level changes.
